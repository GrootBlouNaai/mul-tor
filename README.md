## Todo

1. Identify Broke Sites
2. Temporary Remove Broken Module
3. Simplify this codebase
  - Remove Classes and pointless extracts
  - Document Code
  - Refactor code to be alligned to KISS principles / More "Suckless" (Its python Lol, can't be suckless its slow code but we can try)
4. Re-implement, broken sites
5. Rewrite Uploading and link sorting with async upload management in RustPython
6. Implement Proper Test Framework
7. Create Endpoint for Tulip and SuperPacker
8. Matrix chat module for dumping depots purely with anonymous login + metadata
9. Autoposter?, Appinfo caching? (Should be seperate project, the scope of this rewrite should ideally maintain the sole essence of being an uploader and to not bloat)
