# Mul-Tor
## Your tool for easy file uploading and sharing.

#### Like mentioned above the goal of this tool is to help people upload files fast to multiple hosters while also helping in the process of sharing these links.

### ***Recently Anonfiles thought it would be funny to reenact the soviet union in 1991 so 12 of the 16 sites went down.***

    *1: The progress bar is currently not what i want but its still better than nothing. 
    In the future i can hopefully find a way to show the upload progress.

    *2: FileMail does not need an account but an api key which you can get for simply 
    entering your email or a temp mail (which i suggesst) and localhost as domain and
    then you can use that api key.

    *3: Currently it only checks for updates but in a later release i plan to add an 
    actual auto updater for the zip/folder version. 
    The portable edition probably won't have that feature anytime soon due to me not 
    knowing how to pull it off.
